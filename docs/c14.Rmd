# RShiny C14 dating interactive maps

Today exists a lot of databases or database portals for C14 datings

```{r dat.db}
c14.db.url <- c("http://telearchaeology.org/c14-databses/","http://www.britarch.ac.uk/info/c14.html","http://www.archeometrie.mom.fr/banadora/","http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811")
c14.db.names <- c("telearchaeology","Archaeological Site Index to Radiocarbon Dates from Great Britain and Ireland","BANADORA","EUROEVOL")
c14.db.df <- data.frame(names=c14.db.names,
                        url=c14.db.url,
                        stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(c14.db.df,"html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size=7)
```

Online app also exist for C14 calibration: [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal/), [CalPal](http://www.calpal-online.de/), etc.

But few solutions exist for data vizualisation. Since, the idea was to create an interactive web form map-based for selection of radiocarbon data.

## EUROEVOL_R and NeoNet apps

There is two RShiny apps with the more or less same options. Only the dataset changes:

*[EUROEVOL_R](https://archaepigraph.shinyapps.io/EUROEVOL_R/) is based on the [EUROEVOL database] (http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/) and covers the Central, Western and Northern Europe
*[NeoNet](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/NeoNet/) is based on a Google Sheet and covers the Central Mediterranean


## Tutorial

The apps are divided into 4 panels:

* map
* calib
* data
* credits

### **map** panel

The panel for Radiocarbon Dating by Location, Chronology and Material Life Duration.

```{r panel.map}
library(magick)
panel.map <- image_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoometh/C14/main/docs/imgs/panels_map.png")

```
