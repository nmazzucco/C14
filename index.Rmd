# Radiocarbon chronicles, databases and data visualization

Today exists a lot of databases or database portals for C14 datings

```{r dat.db, echo=FALSE}
c14.db.df <- data.frame(names=c14.db.names,
                        url=c14.db.url,
                        stringsAsFactors = F)
kable(c14.db.df,"html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size=12)
```

Online app also exist for C14 calibration: [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal/), [CalPal](http://www.calpal-online.de/), etc.

But few solutions exist for data vizualisation, and specially selection of radiocarbon dating by location, chronology and material life duration. Since, the idea was to create an interactive web form map-based for selection of radiocarbon data. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) offer easy programming solutions to create such interactive maps.

## The **NeoNet** and **EUROEVOL_R** apps

There is two RShiny apps with the more or less same options. Only the dataset changes:

* **[EUROEVOL_R](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/Euroevol_R/)** is based on the [EUROEVOL database](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/) and covers the Central, Western and Northern Europe from Paleolithic times to the end of Bronze Age (ca. 17,000 - 500 BC) with near to 13,000 C14 datations

* **[NeoNet](https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/NeoNet/)** is the based on a Google Sheet and covers the Central Mediterranean for the Late Mesolithic and Middle Neolithic (ca. 8,000 - 4,500 BC) with near to 1,000 C14 datations. The database is still at its development stage.
